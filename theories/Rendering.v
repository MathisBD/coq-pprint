(** * Pretty-printing monads. *)

(** The rendering engine does not output strings directly : it is parametric over
    a pretty-printing monad, which provides a low-level output interface.
   
    [MonadPPrint Ann M] states that [M] is a monad which supports pretty-printing documents
    with annotations of type [Ann]. The job of [M] is to :
    - accumulate strings : [add_string].
    - deal with annotations of type [Ann] : [enter_annot], [exit_annot]. 

    Annotations can be nested. For instance :
      [enter_annot a1 ;; add_string "hello" ;; 
       enter_annot a2 ;; add_string "world" ;; 
       exit_annot a2 ;; exit_annot a1]
    will print "hello" with annotation [a1] followed by "world" with annotation [a2].
    Calls to [enter_annot]/[exit_annot] are always well-parenthesized.

Class MonadPPrint (Ann : Type) (M : Type -> Type) :=
{
  add_string : string -> M unit ;
  enter_annot : Ann -> M unit ;
  exit_annot : Ann -> M unit ;

Section Rendering.

(** The rendering engine is parameterized by a pretty printing monad. *)
Context {Ann : Type} {M : Type -> Type} {MonadM : Monad M} {MonadPPrintM : MonadPPrint Ann M}.

(** [prettyM doc flat width indent col] is the main function in the rendering engine :
    - [doc] is the document we are printing.
    - [flat] is [true] if we are in flat mode, otherwise it is [false].
    - [width] is the maximum character width we are allowed to use.
    - [indent] is the current indentation level : [indent] blank characters are added after each newline.
    - [col] is the current column index, starting at 0.
    The return value contains the updated column index.

    Making this function tail recursive would require a bit more work.
    I would have to define a [MonadTailRec] class (as in PureScript for instance),
    and require a [MonadTailRec] instance on the pretty printing monad [M].

(** * Basic MonadPPrint instance. *)

(** [PPString A] is a monad that supports pretty-printing documents to strings,
    and simply ignores annotations. It is implemented as a state monad, where the 
    state is the list of strings printed so far (with the most recent strings at
    the head of the list). 
    
    Storing strings in this way allows delaying the actual concatenation until 
    the very end, avoiding the classic quadratic issue with repeated string concatenation. *)
