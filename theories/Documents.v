(** * Width requirements. *)

(** All documents have a space requirement. This is the document's apparent length, 
    if printed in *flattening* mode. 
    This information is computed in a bottom-up manner when the document is constructed.

    In other words, the space requirement is the number of columns that the
    document needs in order to fit on a single line.
*)

  (** [Infinity] is used for a document which cannot be printed on single line.
      This happens e.g. if the document contains a hardline. *)

(** * Documents. *)

(** The type of documents, which depends on the type of annotations.

  (** [Str len s] is an atomic string [s] of _apparent_ length [len].

      The apparent length of a string is the number of (unicode) code points which appear 
      in the string. In general this might be less than the number of bytes in the string : 
      in UTF8 each code point is encoded using 1 to 4 bytes.
   
      We assume (but do not check) that strings do not contain a newline character. *)
  | Str : nat -> string -> doc A
  (** [IfFlat req d1 d2] turns into the document :
      - [d1] in flattening mode.
      - [d2] in normal mode. 
      In particular [req] is equal to the requirement of [d1].
     
      We maintain the invariant that [d1] should not itself be of the form [IfFlat _ _].
      Users should use the function [ifflat] defined below to ensure this invariant is preserved.
  *)
  | IfFlat : requirement -> doc A -> doc A -> doc A
  (** When in flattening mode, [HardLine] causes a failure, which requires
      backtracking all the way until the stack is empty. When not in flattening
      mode, it represents a newline character, followed with an appropriate
      number of indentation. A common way of using [HardLine] is to only use it
      directly within the right branch of an [IfFlat] construct. *)

  (** [Cat req doc1 doc2] is the concatenation of the documents [doc1] and [doc2]. 
      The space requirement [req] is the sum of the requirements of [doc1] and [doc2]. *)

  (** [Nest req n doc] is the document [doc], in which the indentation
      level has been increased by [n], that is in which [n] blanks have been
      inserted after every newline character. 
      The space requirement [req] is the same as the requirement of [doc]. *)
  | Nest : requirement -> nat -> doc A -> doc A
  (** [Group req doc] represents an alternative: it is either a flattened
      form of [doc], in which occurrences of [Group] disappear and occurrences
      of [IfFlat] resolve to their left branch, or [doc] itself. 
      The space requirement [req] is the same as the requirement of [doc]. *)
  | Group : requirement -> doc A -> doc A
  (** [Align req doc] increases the indentation level to reach the current column.
      Thus, the document [doc] is rendered within a box whose upper
      left corner is the current position.
      The space requirement [req] is the same as the requirement of [doc]. *)

(** Storing requirement information at [Group] nodes is crucial, as it allows us to
    avoid backtracking and buffering.

    Storing this information at other nodes allows the function [doc_requirement]
    to operate in constant time. This means that the bottom-up computation of
    requirements takes linear time.
